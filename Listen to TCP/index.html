<h1>Listen to a TCP handshake</h1> 
<p><a href="https://github.com/Emceelamb/DataArtFall2019/tree/master/project-1">github</a>
<p>
For this project I wanted to push myself in thinking about data in non traditional ways while thinking about data capture and real-time data visualization. In addition I wanted to challenge myself in making non-screen based data art. While selecting a source of data I thought about the means of data collection particularly deep packet inspection in countries hostile to internet freedoms. To pursue this I wanted to analyze my own network traffick.
</p><p>

While performing network analysis on myself I was stumped on how to find any meaning with something as low level as a packet. I found that with the world (thankfully) moving towards a more secure future with SSL the packet data themselves did not reveal too much. With more analysis I was intrigued with the TCP protocol itself, particularly the TCP handshake.
</p>
<p>
  When computers connect via TCP they must perform a three-way handshake in order to communicate. The first computer will send a SYNC packet to the other to initialize then the second computer will reply with a SYNC-ACK packet and finally the first computer will acknowledge the reply with a ACK packet completing the handshake. I think there is something quite human about this connnection and decided that this was something I wanted to visualize.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't been doing physical computing or much fabrication in a while, so I decided that would be my medium. I wanted to work with sound because that felt detached from the internet, but also not quite because the internet can trace its history to telegraph and morse code.
</p>
<p>
  I chose solenoids as my tool because of their binary nature, as well as their speed. Internet traffick moves at tremendous speeds so I had to choose a medium that could support those speeds. Originally I wanted to make something more musical but I didn't have time to find affordable instruments so I fabricated my own woodblock and tin drum. I wanted to use different materials to create different sounds to highlight the differences between the request and response packets.
</p>
<p>
  From a technical level I am using and Open-WRT router and iptables to forward traffick from my laptop to a  Raspberry Pi. On the Raspberry Pi I am using tshark to sniff the traffick coming through my computer and filtering for TCP packets. Finally I parse through the captured packets and trigger the solenoids depending on the type of data packet.
</p>
<p>
  What is interesting about the project is that it sonifies in real time the data being sent. Computers can be quite chatty when left idling. I have heard that Amazon Echoes speak to their servers every 15 seconds or so. So it would be interesting to analyze that traffick.
</p>
<p>
  I also think that it could be an interesting teaching tool to visualize computer networking concepts. In an ideal world the sounds would be quite predictible in a 1-2-1 kind of pattern. However because of packet loss and latency this is not the case.
