### Post show notes
- Unexpected
  - packing up for transport
  - sound check
  - 
  - missed timing
 - could be improved with
   - cable management
   - more planning for transport
   - more time for sound check to test projector, camera, audio effects

#### Other findings:   
- I would have gotten soldering lessons earlier
- I would have reconsidered the importance of my panel and probably would not have spent so much time working/ redoing it
- I would have planned it out a little more to not go on goose chases/ start 
- Leave more time for practice
- Practice set up/ rebuilding which would allow more time for sound check
